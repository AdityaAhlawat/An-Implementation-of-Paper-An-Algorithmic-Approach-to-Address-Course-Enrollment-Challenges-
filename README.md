Here is a basic description of my structure for this repository:

- Classes:
There is three clases which represents the main data types in this repository. The file create_data.py is used to create the data that I run to confirm theorems in this reading.

- Implementations:
This is algorithsm and other checkers which I use to check the theorems in the reading.

The files that aren't in any folders are the experiments that I use to check theorems in the reading. 

Here is the reading my code is testing btw:
